<p>Total liabilities were unchanged from the previous fiscal year. On
the other hand, total assets fell significantly below the previous
fiscal year’s level. This is precisely what characterized this term’s
financial results. Specifically, total assets were 2,239,092 yen in the
previous period, while they were 1,533,975 yen lower this period, at
705,117 yen. Let us now take a look at the changes in the main
indicators (Light blue cells in the table) on the balance sheet since
its establishment (Fig-1).</p>

<p>Total assets rose slightly in FY2020 and FY2021, but dropped in
FY2022. Net assets had been continued to fall and picked up in FY2021,
but dropped again in FY2022. Only total liabilities remained flat, as
mentioned above. As a matter of fact, this fiscal year was the first
time since the founding of the corporation that it did not increase its
debt. As a top priority for the foundation, we will continue to aim to
control and reduce the amount of debt in the next fiscal year and
beyond.</p>
<h3 id="net-assets-increasedecrease-statement-for-fy2022">Net Assets
Increase/Decrease Statement for FY2022</h3>
<p>The value of assets minus liabilities is called “net assets”. ”The
Statement of Net Assets Increase/Decrease” records the increase/decrease
in net assets, and shows how money was spent and sales during the
current term (from April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023).</p>

<p>The main indicators (Light blue cells in the table) in “The Statement
of Net Assets Increase/Decrease” are shown in the graph below (Fig-2),
which shows the increase or decrease since the foundation of the
foundation.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./img/fig-2.svg" style="width:90.0%"

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fig-2: Changes in Major Indicators in the

</figure>
<p>Let’s look at them one by one. First, if we look at the change in
“Total ordinary revenues” (yellow line), which represents the ordinary
revenue earned by the foundation, it continued to rise until FY2021, but
then dropped in FY2022. This is the same movement as that of total
assets in the previous section.</p>
<p>To begin with, Ordinary revenues consist of ① Business income (yellow
cells in the table), ② Donation received, and ③ Other revenues. As can
be seen from the Statement of Changes in Net Assets, although ② did
well, exceeding the previous period by 31,952 yen, it is ① that accounts
for most of the total. In other words, the reason for the decrease in
Ordinary revenues was due to the decline in Business income from the
previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>Looking at the indicator “current year ordinary income/expenses”
(pink line), which indicates whether the business results in a loss or a
profit, FY2021 showed a surplus of 882,384 yen, while FY2022 showed a
negative figure of -1,513,975 yen.</p>
<p>Business and administrative expenses are the costs of generating
ordinary income, and ordinary expenses are the sum of the two. Business
expenses were 668,733 yen, up 342,815 yen from FY2021. Administrative
expenses, on the other hand, were 4,229,500 yen, down 946,000 yen from
FY2021. Also, recurring expenses were 4,898,233 yen, down 603,185 yen
from FY2021.</p>
<p>Looking at the “General net assets at end of FY” (red line), which is
the amount of net assets at the end of FY2022, the deficit, which had
continued to grow until FY2020, recovered somewhat in FY2021, but
amounted to 4,050,533 yen in FY2022. The issue will be how to reduce the
deficit in the next fiscal year and beyond.</p>
<p>Now, as the last part of this section, let us explore the causes of
the decline in recurring revenue. Again, business revenue (yellow cells
in the table) accounts for most of the recurring revenue. Therefore, we
have graphed the breakdown of business revenue of 6,267,250 yen in
FY2021 and 3,235,750 yen in FY2022.</p>

<p>While editorial production increased by 1,000,000 yen from the
previous period, contracted development from outside sources, including
maintenance contracts, decreased to 1,685,750 yen, a decrease of
4,031,500 yen from the previous period (Katsuhiro Ogata is in charge of
editorial production, while Representative Director Shinyu Murakami is
mainly responsible for contracted development). In the <a
href="https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle_doc/tree/gh-pages/ja/reports/vivliostyle-report-2021">business
report for FY2021</a>, commissioned development is explained as
follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What catches the eye is that “Business income” raised 6,267,250 yen,
which is 4,763,529 yen more than the previous fiscal year. (omitted)
This was due to the expansion of contract development from external
companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the company’s contracted development sales declined
significantly in the current fiscal year, resulting in a loss.</p>
<h3 id="income-and-expenditure-statement-for-fy2022">Income and
Expenditure Statement for FY2022</h3>
<p>At the end of Chapter 1, we will look at “Income and Expenditure
Statement”, which compares the budgeted amount to the closing amount
during the current fiscal year (April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021).
However, since we have not developed a budget, it will remain a
formality and will be substantially the same as the statement of changes
in net assets in the previous section. The unit of measure is also
yen.</p>

Activity Report for FY2022</strong></h2>
<h3 id="product-development-status-in-terms-of-number-of-prs">Product
development status in terms of number of PRs</h3>
<p>In this chapter, we report on the projects we conducted this fiscal
year. How was the development of products, which is also the purpose of
the foundation of the Foundation? We have tabulated the number of Pull
Requests (PRs) for our main products (Fig-4). Note that this report
excludes PRs by bots and only counts those by humans.</p>

<p>The number of PRs for all the underlying products, <a
href="https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle.js">Vivliostyle.js</a>
is outstanding, and it can be seen that development has made great
progress (For more information on our product structure, see Refer to <a

CLI</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle-pub">Vivliostyle

progressed well. However, PR numbers for products other than these three
were weak.</p>
<h3 id="analysis-of-pr-creator">Analysis of PR Creator</h3>
<p>To summarize so far, there are two distinct groups: the
Vivliostyle.js, Vivliostyle CLI, and Vivliostyle Pub groups, whose
development has gone smoothly, and the less successful <a
href="https://github.com/vivliostyle/vfm">VFM</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/vivliostyle/themes">themes</a> groups. Let us
now turn our attention to the creators of the PRs.</p>

Table-3: Breakdown of PR Creators at Vivliostyle Pub.

</figure>
<p>As can be seen from these tables, in the groups that developed
smoothly, it was Representative Murakami who created many of the PRs. On
the other hand, in the group that did not perform so well, the Murakami
representatives were less involved.</p>
<p>Incidentally, looking at the PR content of Representative Murakami
for Vivliostyle CLI and Vivliostyle Pub, it is clear that it is not PR
to add original functions to Vivliostyle CLI or Vivliostyle Pub, but
rather to add functions and fix bugs in Vivliostyle.js, for which he
himself is a maintainer. for which he is a maintainer, but rather to
spread the addition of features and bug fixes in Vivliostyle.js.</p>
<p>In this way, the development situation of Representative Murakami’s
“solitary struggle,” so to speak, comes to the fore. Of course, as the
founder of the Vivliostyle project, it is only natural that Murakami’s
PR work is heavy. However, in the development of Open Source Software
(OSS), it is not desirable from the standpoint of sustainability to
concentrate too much work on the founder.</p>
<p>However, there were signs that this situation may change this
quarter. Vivliostyle.js, which had been developed almost exclusively by
Murakami, now had two new contributors (Fig-5). Of course, the functions
added by their PR can be used in other products as well.</p>

table of contents and other documents. This has been an issue for some
time and is a long-awaited addition.</p>
<p>Also, a series of <a

of new contributors in the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>Mr. <a
href="https://github.com/orgs/vivliostyle/people/spring-raining">spring-raining</a>,
who has been contributing to our foundation since its establishment, has
made steady and sustained progress in the Vivliostyle CLI this term,
including <a
href="https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle-cli/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#600-2022-12-17">v6.0.0
(2022-12-17)</a> that supports ES Modules and <a

(2023-03-13)</a> that supports VFM v2.</p>
<h3 id="recommendations-for-the-next-fiscal-year">Recommendations for
the next fiscal year</h3>
<p>What can be done to improve the situation described in the previous
section, in which Representative Murakami continues to struggle alone?
The following are two suggestions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Diversification of development resources</li>
<li>Diversification of Business income</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding 1 above. Representative Murakami solitary efforts are not
limited to this fiscal year. We are truly humbled by his efforts, but
unless we can find a way to increase the number of contributors other
than Representative Murakami on a sustained basis, the sustainability of
our organization will be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Regarding 2 above. In order to reduce the burden on Representative
Murakami, we need to diversify our earnings so that our business income
is not solely dependent on contracted development. It is unclear whether
the company will be able to receive as many orders in the next fiscal
year, but it should continue its efforts.</p>
