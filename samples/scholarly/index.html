        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Scholarly HTML is a domain-specific data format built entirely on open standards that
          enables the interoperable exchange of scholarly articles in a manner that is compatible
          with off-the-shelf browsers. This document describes how Scholarly HTML works and how it
          is encoded as a document. It is, itself, written in Scholarly HTML.

          <p>
            This document is an early-stage release. While the underlying format is relatively
            mature and actually implemented, details are still in flux and the format can still be
            changed. The quality of this document is also being gradually improved. If you’re

        <p>
          Scholarly articles are still primarily encoded as unstructured graphics formats in which
          most of the information initially created by research, or even just in the text, is lost.
          This was an acceptable, if deplorable, condition when viable alternatives did not seem
          possible, but document technology has today reached a level of maturity and universality
          that makes this situation no longer tenable. Information cannot be disseminated if it is
          destroyed before even having left its creator’s laptop.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the New York Times, adding structured information to their recipes (instead
          of exposing simply as plain text) improved their discoverability to the point of producing
          an immediate rise of 52 percent in traffic (<a href="#ref-nyt"
          property="schema:citation">NYT, 2014</a>). At this point in time, cupcake recipes are
          reaping greater benefits from modern data format practices than the whole scientific
          endeavour.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not solely a loss for the high principles of knowledge sharing in science, it also
          has very immediate pragmatic consequences. Any tool, any service that tries to integrate
          with scholarly publishing has to spend the brunt of its complexity (or budget) extracting
          data the author would have willingly shared out of antiquated formats. This places
          stringent limits on the improvement of the scholarly toolbox, on the discoverability of
          scientific knowledge, and particularly on processes of meta-analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address these issues, we have followed an approach rooted in established best practices
          for the reuse of open, standard formats. The «HTML Vernacular» body of practice provides
          guidelines for the creation of domain-specific data formats that make use of HTML’s
          inherent extensibility (<a href="#ref-vernacular" property="schema:citation">Science.AI,
          2015b</a>). Using the vernacular foundation overlaid with «schema.org» metadata we have
          produced a format for the interchange of scholarly articles built on open standards, ready
          for all to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our high-level goals were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Uncompromisingly enabling structured metadata, accessibility, and internationalisation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pragmatically working in Web browsers, even if it occasionally incurs some markup
            overhead.
          </li>
          <li>
            Powerfully customisable for inclusion in arbitrary Web sites, while remaining easy to
            process and interoperable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Entirely built on top of open, royalty-free standards.
          </li>
          <li>
            Long-term viability as a data format.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Additionally, in view of the specific problem we addressed, in the creation of this
          vernacular we have favoured the reliability of interchange over ease of authoring; but
          have nevertheless attempted to cater to the latter as much as possible. A decent
          boilerplate template file can certainly make authoring relatively simple, but not as
          radically simple as it can be. For such use cases, Scholarly HTML provides a great output
          target and overview of the data model required to support scholarly publishing at the
          document level.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of an authoring format that was designed to target Scholarly HTML as an
          output is the <a href="http://scienceai.github.io/docx-standard-scientific-style">DOCX
          Standard Scientific Style</a> which enables authors who are comfortable with Microsoft
          Word to author documents that have a direct upgrade path to semantic, standard content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where semantic modelling is concerned, our approach is to stick as much as possible to
          <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>. Beyond the obvious advantages there are in
          reusing a vocabulary that is supported by all the major search engines and is actively
          being developed towards enabling a shared understanding of many useful concepts, it also
          provides a protection against «<em>ontological drift</em>» whereby a new vocabulary is
          defined by a small group with insufficient input from a broader community of practice.
          A language that solely a single participant understands is of limited value.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a small, circumscribed number of cases we have had to depart from
          <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>, using the <code>https://ns.science.ai/</code>
          (prefixed with <code>sa:</code>) vocabulary instead
          (<a href="#ref-sa-ontology" property="schema:citation">Science.AI, 2015a</a>). Our goal is
          to work with <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> in order to extend their
          vocabulary, and we will align our usage with the outcome of these discussions.

        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>
          A <dfn id="scholarly-html">Scholarly HTML document</dfn> is a valid HTML document that
          follows some additional rules to specialise its meaning and make it predictable to
          processors wishing to produce or consume scholarly articles. These rules are outlined in
          the following sections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that in its current state this specification is often informal in the manner
          in which it describes its constraints. This is to facilitate review by people unfamiliar
          with formal specification writing. As the format solidifies, it will be made more formal
          progressively (but attempt to remain readable).
        </p>
        <section id="file-headers">
          <h3>File &amp; Supporting Structure</h3>
          <p>
            The document must be encoded in UTF-8, and transmitted with a media type of
            <code>text/html</code>. It must feature a <code>DOCTYPE</code> as its preamble.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>html</code> root element must feature a valid <code>lang</code> attribute.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>head</code> element of the document must contain a
            <code class="language-html">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"></code> element (preferable as its
            first child), a
            <code class="language-html">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"></code>
            element (and no other viewport <code>meta</code>), and a <code>title</code> element. All
            the other content of the <code>head</code> is ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>body</code> element must have a <code>prefix</code> attribute, which must
            declare the following mapping:
          </p>

          <figure typeof="schema:Table">
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Prefix</th>
                  <th>URL</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tr>
                <td>schema</td>
                <td>http://schema.org/</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>xsd</td>
                <td>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>sa</td>
                <td>https://ns.science.ai/</td>
              </tr>
              <caption>
                The list of mappings that must be declared by the <code>body</code> element.
              </caption>
            </table>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Having to declare prefixes is undoubtably an annoyance and it does hurt the human
            authorability of the format (since hand-creating a document essentially requires a
            boilerplate prefix declaration). This trade-off is made for several reasons. The most
            important motivation is that having predictable prefixes means that the content can be
            styled with CSS using reliable attribute selectors on the semantic information that
            describes the document’s structure. The alternative would be to use URLs everywhere,
            such that instead of <code>sa:Abstract</code> we would have
            <code>https://ns.science.ai/Abstract</code>; but in practice that approach is more
            painful since the content then becomes bloated with URLs that are longer than is
            comfortable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The RDFa content of the article must systematically make use of these prefixes when the
            values match their URLs as prefixes. Authors may declare other prefix-URL mappings in
            the <code>prefix</code> attribute of the <code>body</code> element (or
            <code>prefix</code> attributes elsewhere), including other prefixes mapping to the same
            URLs if needed, but inside of the article’s content these prefixes must be used for
            these URLs.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="article">
          <h3>Article Structure</h3>
          <p>
            The article content is everything that is contained inside the first
            <code>article</code> element in document order that has a
            <code>typeof="schema:ScholarlyArticle"</code>. Everything part of the <code>body</code>
            outside of that subtree is ignored. This enables publishers to surround the article
            content with any amount of supporting markup, for instance for headers, footers,
            or navigation, as well as to wrap the article inside arbitrary markup that may be
            needed for stylistic reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>article</code> element should have
            a <code>resource</code> attribute, usually with a value
            of <code>#</code>. The reason for that is to grant it a
            URL that can be targeted by other properties. The
            <code>resource</code> attribute can take any value, but it
            must then be matched by the
            <code>about</code> attributes of the properties targeting
            it. If <code>resource</code> is omitted, the only way in
            which those properties can target it is by knowing the URL
            from which the document was retrieved.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first element child of the <code>article</code> element must be an <code>h1</code>
            heading that serves as the primary title for the document. It may itself contain markup.
            The white-space-normalised text value of the <code>h1</code> must appear as a substring
            of the white-space-normalised text value of the <code>title</code> element. This ensures
            semantic alignment between the two, while enabling publishers to add their name to the
            <code>title</code> so as to identify themselves there alongside the content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any children of <code>article</code> that are not <code>section</code> elements are
            ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first <code>section</code> child element of the <code>article</code> must be the
            <a href="#authors">Authors and Affiliations</a> section. It has no <code>typeof</code>
            and its specific rules are outlined in its own chapter below.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>section</code> elements can be nested arbitrarily deep. Each
            <code>section</code> element must have as its first element child an <code>hX</code>
            heading element the numeric part of which must be the number of <code>section</code>
            ancestor elements that heading elements has up to the <code>article</code> element, plus
            one. If the numeric part is greater than 6, then <code>h6</code> must be used but an
            <code>aria-level</code> attribute must be added that reflects the accurate depth.
            (The <code>aria-level</code> attribute can be used at lower depths but is not required
            there.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Each <code>section</code> element may contain an arbitrary number of
            <a href="#hunk-elements">hunk elements</a>, followed by an arbitrary number of
            <code>section</code> elements being subsections. Note that
            <a href="#hunk-elements">hunk elements</a> must imperatively appear <em>before</em> the
            subsections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sections are expected to be typed using the <code>typeof</code> attribute. The following
            <code>typeof</code> values are currently understood:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>sa:Funding</code> (which has its <a href="#funding">specific structure</a>)</li>
            <li><code>sa:Abstract</code></li>
            <li><code>sa:MaterialsAndMethods</code></li>
            <li><code>sa:Results</code></li>
            <li><code>sa:Conclusion</code></li>
            <li><code>sa:Acknowledgements</code></li>
            <li><code>sa:ReferenceList</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Hopefully these types are largely self-documenting, they are described further in the
            Scholarly Article ontology
            (<a href="#ref-sa-ontology" property="schema:citation">Science.AI, 2015a</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            The section typed <code>sa:ReferenceList</code> has special processing rules described
            in the <a href="#references-section">References section</a>.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="hunk-elements">
          <h3>Hunk Elements</h3>
          <p>
            <dfn>Hunk elements</dfn> are the meaningful blocks from which sections are built. They
            contain text and <a href="#inline-element">inline elements</a>. There are several
            types of hunk elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most common hunk element is <code>p</code>, which is used to capture paragraphs. It
            requires no special processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>blockquote</code>, <code>ul</code>, <code>ol</code>, and <code>dl</code>
            elements can be used as they typically would and require no special treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>aside</code> hunk element is used to capture text boxes. If it contains an
            <code>hX</code> heading element, that element must be its first element child and its
            numeric part must reflect its depth, making use of <code>aria-level</code> according to
            the same rules as apply for <code>section</code>. The other children of
            <code>aside</code> must all be hunk elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>figure</code> element is a general container for content units that are
            embedded inside the main body of the text. It can come in several flavours that are
            dictated by its <code>typeof</code> attribute.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <code>figure</code> has <code>typeof="sa:Image"</code> then it is an image container.
            It must contain an <code>img</code> child element and should contain a
            <code>figcaption</code> labelling that image. An example of an image figure would be:
          </p>
          <figure typeof="sa:Image">
            <img src="hop-less.png" width="880" height="655">

            If <code>figure</code> has <code>typeof="sa:Table"</code> then it is a table container.
            It must contain nothing other than a <code>table</code> element. If a caption is
            available, it should be included using the <code>caption</code> child element of the

            If <code>figure</code> has <code>typeof="sa:Formula"</code> then it is a formula
            container. It must contain a <code>math</code> element and optionally a
            <code>figcaption</code> describing the formula. The <code>math</code> element must be
            valid MathML 3. Additionally, given the dismal state of support for MathML in Web
            browser the <code>math</code> element must contain an <code>annotation</code>
            descendant with the TeX equivalent of the formula.

            If <code>figure</code> has <code>typeof="schema:SoftwareSourceCode"</code>

            If you wish to specify the type of the language used in the code, the

            elements (<code>caption</code> and <code>figcaption</code>) the following inline

            If an <code>a</code> element is linking to a citation, then it must have
            <code>property="schema:citation"</code>; if it is linking
            to a figure or another creative work, it must
            have <code>property="schema:hasPart"</code>
            or <code>property="schema:isBasedOnUrl"</code>. These are
            known as <dfn>flavoured links</dfn>, they can be used to
            enhance the user experience by treating their behaviour
            differently from regular links.

          <p>
            The references section is a special type of <code>section</code> element with

          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from its heading element, it must contain nothing other than an <code>ol</code>
            or a <code>dl</code> element.

          <p>
            If using a <code>dl</code> element, its content must be exclusively a strictly
            alternating sequence of <code>dt</code> then <code>dd</code> elements, with the latter
            being the citation-bearing element. The <code>dt</code> is used as a label in some

          <p>
            If using an <code>ol</code>, then its content is only <code>li</code> elements that are

            The citation-bearing element will have an <code>id</code> and be

            references section of this document is an example.

          <p>
            At the semantics level, a citation is a <code>schema:ScholarlyArticle</code> (or subtype)
            with an <code>id</code> to reference it internally in the document and a
            <code>resource</code> that is a URL identifying it (its DOI for instance, preferable in
            HTTP-retrievable form).
          </p>
          <p>
            That <code>schema:ScholarlyArticle</code> has any number of <code>schema:author</code>
            which are <code>schema:Person</code> (with the usual <code>schema:givenName</code>,
            <code>schema:familyName</code>, etc.). A child <code>cite</code> element, with
            <code>property="schema:name"</code> (and optionally a link child) provides the title
            of the article.
          </p>
          <p>
            The publisher is described using a nested <code>schema:isPartOf</code> structure of
            <code>schema:PublicationIssue</code>, <code>schema:PublicationVolume</code>,
            and <code>schema:Periodical</code> (with only those that are known being used). Both
            <code>schema:volumeNumber</code> and <code>schema:issueNumber</code> may be used on the
            volume and issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <code>time</code> element with <code>property="schema:datePublished"</code> provides
            the publication date, which is expressed in text in human-readable form and in the
            <code>datetime</code> attribute in standard form. A <code>datatype</code> attribute
            matching the date format must be provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both <code>schema:pageStart</code> and <code>schema:pageEnd</code> may be provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond the semantics, a more specific serialisation known a «Flexcite» is in the works
            and will be added here soon. Its properties are simple: when unstyled it reads linearly
            in a human-friendly manner (so as to be accessible), and it can be styled with CSS to be
            turned into arbitrary citation style preferences.

          <h3>The Authors &amp; Affiliations Section</h3>
          <p>
            Capturing authors, the affiliations and their relationship to the article is the most
            intricate part of Scholarly HTML. Care was taken to avoid repetition and to keep the
            markup density as reasonable as possible, but the data to content ratio remains
            relatively high.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is probably best to start from an example and then to explain it:

          <p>
            This <code>section</code> has no <code>typeof</code> and
            no heading element. It contains a first <code>ol</code>
            which lists authors, and optionally a
            second <code>ol</code> to list affiliations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each <code>li</code> in the authors <code>ol</code> has
            <code>property="schema:author"</code> or <code>property="schema:contributor"</code> and a
            <code>typeof="sa:ContributorRole"</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <code>sa:ContributorRole</code> type (following the
            semantic of
            schema.org <a href="http://schema.org/Role">Role</a>) is
            used so that affiliations or contact informations (email
            address, etc.) relevant to this specific scholarly article
            (and this specific scholarly article only) can be
            specified. This is important as authors may have different
            affiliations and contact points at the time they are
            publishing a scholarly article but may want to specify
            only a subset of those. Readers not familiar with the
            semantic of schema.org Role can consult
            the <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2014/06/introducing-role.html">introductory
            blog post</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside of that <code>li</code>, arbitrary properties
            of <code>schema:Person</code>, filling
            the <code>schema:author</code> property of
            the <code>sa:ContributorRole</code> can be specified, but
            providing at least <code>schema:givenName</code> and
            <code>schema:familyName</code>. It is recommended that
            these properties are wrapped into an hyperlink
            identifying the person with a URL to their home page,
            their <a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>, or an email
            address.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there is an affiliations <code>ol</code> and a given
            author is affiliated, there must be an <code>a</code>
            element with its <code>href</code> pointing to that
            affiliation, a <code>resource</code> matching the URL
            identifying the affiliation,
            and <code>property="schema:roleAffiliation"</code>. The
            content of that <code>a</code> element must be a string
            that matches the one that will be generated by CSS to
            label the affiliation; Latin lowercase being
            recommended. (This is a hack, but we can only do so much
            within the limits of CSS — better <code>counter</code>
            would be needed.)
          </p>
          <p>
            If an author (or contributor) is a corresponding author, a
            last <code>sup</code> element needs to be added to
            its <code>li</code>
            with <code>property="sa:roleContactPoint"</code>, <code>typeof="schema:ContactPoint"</code>
            (or subclass). Inside the <code>sup</code> element, there
            must be at least a link to the contributor email address
            (<code>mailto:</code>). More contact information such as
            properties of <code>schema:PostalAddress</code> may be
            added using <code>meta</code> tags.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there is an affiliations <code>ol</code>, each <code>li</code> in it must have an
            <code>id</code> which the authors link to. In turn it contains an <code>a</code>
            element linking to the affiliation with <code>typeof</code> set to either
            <code>schema:Organization</code> or <a href="http://schema.org/Organization">one of its
            subtypes</a>. Inside the <code>a</code> needs to sit a <code>span</code> (or any
            acceptable element, really) with <code>property="schema:name"</code>, containing the
            name.

            As for contributor affiliations, source of fundings are
            expressed using a subclass of <code>schema:Role</code> (<code>sa:SponsorRole</code>).
            The usage of schema.org <code>Role</code> type is needed
            to describe the source of fundings specific to a scholarly
            article as opposed to all the source of funding of an
            organization (relevant or not to our scholarly article of
            interest).
          </p>
          <p>
            The funder will be <code>typeof="schema:Organization"</code> (or a subtype thereof), as the object of a
            <code>schema:sponsor</code> property on the <code>sa:SponsorRole</code>. It
            will be identified through its URL (as in the <code>a</code> above), and will typically
            have <code>schema:name</code> and often <code>schema:alternateName</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The specific source of funding is of type <code>sa:FundingSource</code>, as the object of a
            <code>sa:roleOffer</code> property on the <code>sa:SponsorRole</code>. It
            should have a URL identifying it and a <code>schema:serialNumber</code> that is its
            labeled identity.

          <h3>Data rich scholarly articles</h3>
          <p>
            Scholarly Articles are often part of a larger network of
            creative works containing dataset, code, additional
            figures, tables or media (audio, video). Even within a
            scholarly article, some creative works can be encoded in
            different ways (for instance, figures typically comes in
            different resolutions). Scholarly HTML aims to formally
            describe (and help archive) this larger context.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further data about a scholarly graph can be exposed within
            the article in RDFa or as
            <a href="http://json-ld.org">JSON-LD</a> islands. When
            JSON-LD is used, it is recommended not to duplicate the
            data already serialized in RDFa. JSON-LD should be
            reserved to expose data not directly present in the HTML
            markup.

          <p>
            Scholarly Articles (and their associated resources) are
            frequently tagged to improve their discoverability. For
            instance,
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Library_of_Medicine">National

            Subject Headings</a> (MeSH) controlled vocabulary to index
            journal articles in the life sciences. Scholarly HTML
            leverages schema.org and the <code>schema:about</code>
            property to efficiently expose this information to search
            engines. When possible,
            schema.org <a href="http://schema.org/MedicalEntity">MedicalEntity</a>
            (and subclasses) should be used to describe biomedical
            concepts.

          Scholarly HTML would like to thank <a href="http://scholarlyhtml.org/">Scholarly HTML</a>
          (you read that right) for blazing the trail perhaps a few years too soon. Particularly,
          the following people were particularly kind and helpful:
          <a href="https://twitter.com/ptsefton">Peter Sefton</a>,
          <a href="https://twitter.com/blahah404">Richard Smith-Unna</a>, and
          <a href="https://twitter.com/petermurrayrust">Peter Murray-Rust</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          PLOS has a
          <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/03/19/a-very-brief-history-of-scholarly-html/">short
          history of Scholarly HTML</a> that is worth reading (and would be worth updating).
        </p>
        <p>
          Dan Brickley was kind enough to drop by the office to chat about our usage of
          <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> even though he was tired and hungry. As always,
          examples involving fish tanks are the most helpful. Tzviya Siegman and Dave Cramer have
          shared ideas that we happily stole.
        </p>
        <p>
          Patrick Johnston's input has been crucial, notably in modelling authoring. We can only
          hope that getting those details exactly right have not caused him to lose too much sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also received very useful feedback and pointers from: Kjetil Kjernsmo (DAHUT!), Silvio
          Peroni, Justin Johansson, Alf Eaton, Raniere Silvia, and Mike Smith.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we somehow forgot you in this list and you are too gracious to complain, we love you
          all the same.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Scholarly HTML is currently a work in progress and is open to change. If you have
          feedback, simply
          <a href="https://github.com/scienceai/scholarly.vernacular.io/issues">open an issue</a> on
          GitHub, or <a href="https://github.com/scienceai/scholarly.vernacular.io">make a pull
          request</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that this vernacular establishes that it is possible to capture scholarly
          information accurately, while retaining a clean HTML structure that does minimum violence
          to the language’s spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The science.ai platform currently supports (most of) Scholarly HTML, but our goal is not
          to make this a proprietary standard — quite the opposite. We would like the scholarly
          publishing as much as possible to align with common practices so that we can all focus on
          problems more interesting than content conversion.
